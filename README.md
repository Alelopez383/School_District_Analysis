# School_District_Analysis
Analysis on standarized tests scores and student funding using Jupiter Notebook, Pandas and Numpy Library.

# Overview of the school district analysis: 
We are tasked to provide insights about the performance trends and patterns for spending and performance in several high schools. These insights will provide information for the discussion and strategic decisions at the school and district level for spending bills ans standarized tests.

Therefore, an analysis was carried out at the District level, by school, by school grade, by budget granted, by size and type of school.

However, stemming from a possible grade conflict or possible fraud at Thomas Middle School, it was requested that all the 9th grades be dropped, which implied a change in the results of the previous analyzes

# Results: 

## 1. How is the district summary affected?
We can observe that initially, the changes to eliminate the grades of the ninth grade of the Thomas High School, did not show strong implications at the district level, since the math and reading averages remained unchanged, as well wiwth the percentages of passing math, reading an overall.

## 2. How is the school summary affected?

At the school level, the removal of THS's 9th grade tests did not have any implications for the other schools. However, we can see that in terms of the percentages of students passing in math, reading and overall passing the school had a strong withdrawal of approved students if the 9th grades are out of the countability. The drop in the percentage of students who passed math, falls 26.36 percentage points; reading falls 27.65 percentage points; and the overall passing, drops 25.87 percentage points.

## 3.How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
One of the main implications of removing grades from the ninth grade was the drop in positions with respect to other schools; because when those grades were included, THS ranked as the second school with the highest percentage of students passing. Now, without the 9th, it ranks ninth out of 15.

However, if only the grades of the other grades (10th-12th) are taken into account, it is shown that THS continues to be the school with the second highest number of approved students; so if there is any question of fraud in the 9th, the results of the other grades could corroborate that in fact, said grades remain in accordance with the level of the school in general.

Although they did raise the approval percentages a little, they were marginal.
